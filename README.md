### üìâ Understanding Churn

**Churn** (or **customer churn**), also known as customer attrition, is the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or discontinue a service within a given time period. In the context of a subscription-based service, a customer has "churned" when they cancel their subscription.

### üìä Churn Rate & Formula

The **Churn Rate** is a business metric that calculates the percentage of subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions during a specific time period. It is a critical indicator of customer satisfaction, business health, and long-term profitability.

The most common formula for calculating churn rate is:

#### **Customer Churn Rate (%)**

```
Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Lost During Period / Total Number of Customers at Start of Period) * 100
```

**Example Calculation:**

*   **Customers at Start of Period:** 500
*   **Customers Lost During Period:** 25
*   **Churn Rate:** (25 / 500) * 100 = **5%**

### ü§î Why It Matters

A high churn rate can signal problems with a company's product, pricing, or customer service. Conversely, a low churn rate suggests high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The primary goal of churn analysis is to identify the factors that cause customers to leave and develop strategies to improve **customer retention**.
